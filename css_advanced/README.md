# CSS Advanced

This project is part of the **ALX HTML & CSS curriculum**. It builds upon the previous "HTML, Advanced" project, shifting focus from semantic structure to full visual styling using **modern CSS techniques**.

## Objectives

- Apply advanced CSS styling to a semantically structured HTML page
- Use Flexbox and Grid for layout
- Integrate web fonts and icons
- Implement responsive design using media queries
- Style interactive elements (buttons, cards, testimonials)
- Enhance visual aesthetics without JavaScript

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – The structured HTML file provided from the previous project
- `README.md` – Project overview and purpose (you are reading it now)
- (Future) `styles.css` – The stylesheet that will bring the design to life

## Preview

This project is a static webpage inspired by a **Figma design** showcasing a fictional learning platform called "SmileSchool". The goal is to make the page match the original design with close attention to spacing, typography, alignment, and overall visual quality.
