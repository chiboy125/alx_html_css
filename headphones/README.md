# Headphones Landing Page

This is a fully responsive landing page for a fictional headphones brand, implemented from scratch using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The design was created by Nicolas Philippot and provided as a Figma file.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to reproduce the Figma design as closely as possible without using any CSS frameworks or JavaScript. It demonstrates advanced use of:

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Responsive design techniques
- Flexbox and Grid layouts
- Font integration and asset management
- Accessibility best practices
